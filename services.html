    <p> </p>
    <p>Web applications are those that can be accessed through the Internet (or through an Intranet).They need to be installed only once and make it convenient for the users to access the application from any location using the Internet. Web application development relies significantly on Internet connectivity and speed. </p

    <h2> Desktop Applications</h2>
    <p> </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Desktop applications instead are the applications that are meant to be installed separately on each computer. They are standalone in nature and hence do not face any hindrances resulting from Internet connectivity. </p>
